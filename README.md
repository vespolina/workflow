Workflow is a library that lets you first build a graph with places and transactions
interconnecting them with arcs. And then lets you traverse the created workflow for
any number of runs each identifiable via a token. The traversing starts on an input
place node and ends in an output place node for a given workflow. Workflow uses a
logger to log the flow traversing details.

The tokenable nodes can execute custom implementations. These custom implementations
can be used to carry out flows on processes of a web application or other process
based systems.

Install
=======

```
composer require vespolina/workflow dev-master
```
Usage
=====

Suppose we want a workflow like this:
```

  O -> [A] -> O -> [B] -> O
 in          p1          out

```

The code that implements and runs down on it would look like:
```php
 <?php

use Vespolina\Workflow\Task\Automatic;
use Vespolina\Workflow\Place;
use Vespolina\Workflow\Workflow;
use Vespolina\Workflow\Token;
use Monolog\Logger;

$logger = new Logger('test');
$workflow = new Workflow($logger);

// create sequence
$a = new Automatic();
$b = new Automatic();
$p = new Place();

$workflow->connect($workflow->getInput(), $a);
$workflow->connect($a, $p);
$workflow->connect($p, $b);
$workflow->connect($b, $workflow->getOutput());

$workflow->accept(new Token());
```

And we will see the traversing in our logs:

```cli
... test.INFO: Token accepted into workflow
... test.INFO: Token accepted into workflow.input
... test.INFO: Token accepted into Vespolina\Workflow\Task\Automatic
... test.INFO: Token accepted into Vespolina\Workflow\Place
... test.INFO: Token accepted into Vespolina\Workflow\Task\Automatic
... test.INFO: Token accepted into workflow.output
```
